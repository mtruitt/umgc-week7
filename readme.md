## Week 7 â€“ Exceptions
Use the Java hierarchy you posted in week 5 (corrected based on any feedback you may have received). Add a user-defined exception that can be thrown by one of the methods as part of the validation or error checking. The main method should then create an instance of the class and call the method in such a way that the exception is thrown (e.g. invalid input or state of the system). Submit your program as an attached  .java file and post a screenshot to show that you have been able to successfully run that program.
